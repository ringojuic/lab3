## Problem 1
Write a function that takes in a list of integers as an argument
and returns true if it contains two integers that are the same, false
otherwise.

Nested Loop:  
Uses nested for loops to search for a pair of numbers  
Easy to program, and easy to understand  
Bigger time complexity (O(n^2))

Set:
Attempt to add a value to the set, return depending on if add was succesfull
Harder to program, harder to understand
Lower time complexity
